# Toyota_Web_Data

This program scrapes cars.com speccially for toyota. It pulls Vehicles, MSRP, Mileage, Drive, Dealer information (location, rating, phone nunmber)

Using plotly I am able to char Avg MSRP and mileage by model. There is an interactive feature where the user can hover over the data and see what the values are, there is also a 
widget that will allow the user to toggle the chart to be model specific. There is also a table using plotly that neatly illustrates what the average data is by model.
